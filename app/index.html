        <p>We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. From science to politics, there are so many amazing speeches that need to be heard. Thinkers, Do-ers, scientists, artists and so many more can become the symbol of a generation. Our goal is to gather and help to spread the best talks to our members. We're devoted to spreading ideas and powerful talks. Share knowledge. Share your vision of the world.</p>
